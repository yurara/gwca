## Guild Wars Client API ##

<br />

## **VERY IMPORTANT! ArenaNet have taken heavy measures against botting in GW and apparently have added detection of programs like GWCA. Use at own risk from now on! This project is now officially archived!** ##

<br /><br />

The **Guild Wars Client API** (GWCA) provides a large set of functions/features for interacting with Guild Wars.

The purpose is to mimic anything that the Client would be able to do. Truthfully though, this goal has never been fully reached as it is quite a mouthful.

If you are new to GWCA, please read the [First Time User Guide](http://code.google.com/p/gwca/wiki/FirstTimeUserGuide) before starting to use the API.
The [Troubleshooting](http://code.google.com/p/gwca/wiki/Troubleshooting) guide could also be of importance if GWCA won't work right away.

Please also check out the wonderful official [Multi-Client Patch](http://gwca.googlecode.com/files/Multiclient%20Patch.rar) that allows you to run unlimited instances of the client without having to copy files!
<br /><br />

When compiling, remember always to do so in **Release** mode.
